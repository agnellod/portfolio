# portfolio
In this portfolio I wrote html and css code to show you a little about me as well as show you what we have been working on in class
I used css to style the page so that the boxes of info were stacked together
I also used html to link the parts of my webpage together
I linked my github at the bottom of the page so you could check out my past work even tho there isnt much there yet
some challenges i faced during this was figuring out better css styling commands
Also the responsive layout was a challenge in itself
