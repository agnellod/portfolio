            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a 27 year old just looking to keep learning new things. I've always had an interest in how apps and
                websites were created and run so figured I'd finally give it a shot. Some of my interests include
                permaculture which I am certified in as well as skateboarding, snowboarding, and disc golf. My job
                history is all over the place from cooking jobs to ski school instructor to permaculture design. I've
                also live all over the country but currently reside in Denver. I don't have any work experience in coding but ill be adding to this portfolio as I complete my coding boot camp.
