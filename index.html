        <h2>About me</h2>
             <p>
                I'm a 27 year old just looking to keep learning new things. I've always had an interest in how apps and websites were created and run so figured I'd finally give it a shot. Some of my interests include permaculture which I am certified in as well as skateboarding, snowboarding, and disc golf. My job history is all over the place from cooking jobs to ski school instructor to permaculture design. I've also live all over the country but currently reside in Denver.
